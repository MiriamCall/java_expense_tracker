# Overview

The purpose of this project is to learn Java but also build an expense tracker. My husband and I are working on learning more about budgeting so by building this app I was able to create something that can help us as we budget. It tracks what expenses were made and where that money goes.

This project, written in Java, is an expense tracker. I felt building this would help me understand how the Java language works and its differences from Javascript.

# Development Environment

The tools I used to develop this program were VS Code and a few Java extensions for it.

I used Java to write this program. It is a similar language to C or C++.

# Future Work

- To improve this I could add better detailed insights that may be more applicable to the user.
- I could add a place to enter what the goal is for budgeting and then they can see how close they are to that when looking at their expenses.
- I could update the date so the user could manually put in the date instead of just using the set one.
